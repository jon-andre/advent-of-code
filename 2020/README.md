# AoC 2020
Let's see how long I can keep up

## 1
* Find two numbers that sums to 2020. Hash lookup.
* Find three numbers that sums to 2020. Hash lookup. Look for what two numbers the first number needs to become 2020
Binary search is a potential solution.

## 2
* Validate pattern. Sum of chars must be in an interval.
* Validate pattern. Char at position must be present.
RegEx is a potential solution.

## 3
* Find sum of chars at certain x positions. Counter will become larger than index.
* Find product of sum of chars at certain x and y positions.
Cycle is a potential solution.
